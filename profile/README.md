An initiative started by Carlos ([@cptanalatriste](https://github.com/cptanalatriste), from the Alan Turing Institute), and Sofía ([@sfmig](https://github.com/sfmig), from the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre at UCL), from a conversation at the DEI workshop during [RSECon24](https://rsecon24.society-rse.org/). Our aims are:
- to showcase the RSE role across the Spanish-speaking world, 
- to get in touch with the cool research and tech carried out by hispanophones all over the world, and 
- to selfishly speak our mother tongue before we forget it.

We have an exciting list of speakers lined up for what we plan to be a monthly series. Stay tuned! 📻
